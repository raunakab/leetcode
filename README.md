# LeetCode
Implementations of various LeetCode problems.

Do I think that asking LeetCode questions is an effective interviewing strategy?
No.

But will I do it regardless because that's the only way to get a job?
Yes.

Do I have skill issues?
Obviously.

## Structure
All the LeetCode questions are in the `algos` directory.
The `playground` directory acts as a place where I can experiment with some interesting concepts in different languages (e.g., writing/consuming iterators in Python).
